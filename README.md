# MyBinder Front-End

This repository is the front-end of the MyBinder project.

# Setting up the development environment

First, clone the repository and then install the dependencies.

```
git clone git@github.com:my-binder/front-end.git
cd front-end
npm run install
```

Now you need to set up the development environment variables. Make an `.env` file with the `VITE_API_URL` containing the URL of the back-end, which you need to be running. Then, it will be available at port 5173 after running the following command:

```
npm run dev
```
